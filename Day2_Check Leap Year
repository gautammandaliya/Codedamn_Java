Q1.
Write a method named isLeapYear in the Main class to determine whether a given year is a leap year.

Instructions:
1. Method Signature:
--> The method must be public and static.
--> It should be named isLeapYear.
--> Accept a single int parameter representing the year.
--> Return a boolean value - true if the year is a leap year, false otherwise.
2. Leap Year Calculation:
--> A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
--> However, if the year is also divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless...
--> The year is also divisible by 400. In this case, it is a leap year.
--> Example: The year 2000 is a leap year because it is divisible by 400. However, 1900 is not a leap year because, although divisible by 100, it is not divisible by 400.
3. Testing Edge Cases:
--> Your method will be tested with various years to ensure it covers all scenarios, including typical leap years, common non-leap years, and century leap years.
--> Example 1: isLeapYear(2000) should return true.
--> Example 2: isLeapYear(1989) should return false.

Edge Cases:
--> Century Years: These are years like 1900, 2000, and 2100. Remember, only those century years that are divisible by 400 are leap years.
--> Typical Leap and Non-Leap Years: Years like 2012 (leap year) and 2019 (non-leap year) should be correctly identified based on their divisibility by 4.

By the end of this lab, your method should be able to accurately determine if a given year is a leap year, considering all the mathematical rules and edge cases.

Code:-
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test cases
        System.out.println("2000 is leap year: " + isLeapYear(2000)); // Should return true
        System.out.println("1989 is leap year: " + isLeapYear(1989)); // Should return false
        System.out.println("2100 is leap year: " + isLeapYear(2100)); // Should return false
    }

    // Implement the "isLeapYear" method
    public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {
            return true; // It is a leap year
        } else {
            return false; // It is not a leap year
        }
    }
}
