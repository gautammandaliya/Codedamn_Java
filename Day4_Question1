Q1.
In this lab, you will be tasked with implementing a method in Java named isPrimeNumber. This method will determine whether a given number is a prime number.

Objectives
1. Implement the isPrimeNumber Method:
--> Your method should be named isPrimeNumber and be part of the Main class.
--> It should take a single integer input.
--> The method should return a boolean value: True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.

Key Concepts
--> Prime Number: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
-->Edge Cases: Pay special attention to edge cases like 0, 1, and negative numbers. None of these are prime numbers, so your method should return False for these inputs.

Examples
1. Example with a Prime Number
--> Input: 5
--> Expected Output: True
--> Reason: 5 is a prime number as it has no divisors other than 1 and 5 itself.
2. Example with a Non-Prime Number
--> Input: 4
--> Expected Output: False
--> Reason: 4 is not a prime number as it can be divided evenly by 2 (apart from 1 and 4).

Instructions
1. Create the isPrimeNumber Method:
--> Define the method within the Main class.
--> Ensure the method accepts a single integer parameter and returns a boolean.
2. Handle Edge Cases:
--> Your method should correctly return False for 0, 1, and any negative numbers, as these are not prime.
3. Testing Your Code:
--> You can test your method with various inputs, including prime numbers, non-prime numbers, and edge cases.

Challenges Information
Challenge 1: Method Existence and Correct Return Type
--> Objective: Ensure that a method named isPrimeNumber exists in the Main class and it returns a boolean value.
--> Requirement:
      The method must be named exactly isPrimeNumber.
      The return type of the method should be boolean (True or False).
Challenge 2: Test Case for 0
--> Objective: Verify that the isPrimeNumber method returns False when 0 is passed as an input.
--> Requirement:
      Input: 0
      Expected Output: False
      Rationale: 0 is not a prime number, so the method should return False.
Challenge 3: Test Case for 3
--> Objective: Test that the isPrimeNumber method returns True when 3 is passed as an input.
--> Requirement:
      Input: 3
      Expected Output: True
      Rationale: 3 is a prime number and should be correctly identified as such.
Challenge 4: Test Case for 2
--> Objective: Confirm that the isPrimeNumber method returns True when 2 is passed as an input.
--> Requirement:
      Input: 2
      Expected Output: True
      Rationale: 2 is the smallest and only even prime number.
Challenge 5: Test Case for 99
--> Objective: Ensure that the isPrimeNumber method returns False when 99 is passed as an input.
--> Requirement:
      Input: 99
      Expected Output: False
      Rationale: 99 is not a prime number as it can be divided by numbers other than 1 and 99.
Challenge 6: Test Case for Negative Numbers
--> Objective: Validate that the isPrimeNumber method returns False for any negative number input.
--> Requirement:
      Input: Any negative number (e.g., -1, -5, -10)
      Expected Output: False
      Rationale: Prime numbers are positive, natural numbers greater than 1. Therefore, all negative numbers should return False.
This lab will test your understanding of prime numbers, your ability to implement logical conditions in Java, and your attention to detail, especially regarding edge cases. Good luck!

Code:-
class Main {
     static int count = 0;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example test cases
        System.out.println("Is 0 prime? " + isPrimeNumber(0)); // Expected: false
        System.out.println("Is 3 prime? " + isPrimeNumber(3)); // Expected: true
        System.out.println("Is 2 prime? " + isPrimeNumber(2)); // Expected: true
        System.out.println("Is 99 prime? " + isPrimeNumber(99)); // Expected: false
        System.out.println("Is -5 prime? " + isPrimeNumber(-5)); // Expected: false
    }

    // Create the "isPrimeNumber" method here. Accepts Integer value as parameter and should return a boolean value
    public static boolean isPrimeNumber(int number){
        if(number <= 1){
            return false;
        }
        if(number == 2){
            return true;
        }
        for(int i = 1; i <= number; i++){
            if(number % i == 0){
                count++;
            }
        }
        if(count == 2){
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
